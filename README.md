Perfect — that’s just the default Vite scaffold README. For your open-source project you’ll want to replace it with something project-specific. Here’s a lean version you can drop in right now (and keep USAGE.md for the deeper theory):

RGB-LLM Prompt Mapper

A minimal open-source React + Vite app for reasoning about three poles of any problem using the RGB color model. Each axis (R, G, B) represents a tension or emphasis. The sliders produce both a structured JSON output and a color swatch as intuitive feedback.

👉 Do you want me to also include the GitHub Actions YAML snippet in the README (under “Deploy”) so contributors can see exactly what workflow file powers the Pages build?
